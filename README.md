## Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to implementing various authentication methods. Each method is demonstrated with both frontend and backend components, ensuring a complete understanding of the integration process. The examples are designed to be clear and concise, making it easy for you to implement them in your own projects.

## Authentication Methods

### JWT Authentication

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. This method involves generating and validating JWTs to manage user authentication.

### Cookie-based Authentication

Cookie-based authentication uses HTTP cookies to maintain user sessions. The backend sets a cookie with the authentication token, which is automatically included in subsequent requests by the browser.

### Google Authentication

Google authentication uses OAuth 2.0 to allow users to log in using their Google account. This method involves registering your application with Google and handling the OAuth flow to authenticate users.

### GitHub Authentication

GitHub authentication allows users to log in using their GitHub account. Similar to Google authentication, this involves registering your application with GitHub and managing the OAuth flow.

### Supabase Authentication

Supabase provides a backend as a service with integrated authentication. This example demonstrates how to use Supabase's authentication features to manage user login and registration.

### Firebase Authentication

Firebase Authentication provides backend services to help authenticate users in your application. This example covers how to set up Firebase and integrate its authentication features.
